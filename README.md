Name’s 1Lt. Muhammad.<br>
Medical student at Cairo University by day—programmer, designer, and relentless learner by choice. I don’t follow the beaten path. I carve my own.<br>
I don’t chase praise. I don’t waste time on small talk. I care about results—nothing else.<br>
I’ve spent years sharpening my skills in game modding, tools development, 3D modeling, and scripting—hands-on, purpose-driven. 3ds Max, Photoshop, Python—all tools in a growing arsenal. I move across disciplines because I refuse to be limited by one field, one title, or one system.<br>
If no one’s capable—I become the solution.<br>
If the system fails—I build a better one.<br>
And if chaos takes over—I take control.<br>
I’m not here to play catch-up. I’m here to level up—constantly.<br>
I’m not your typical student. I don't wait for the future—I build it. One skill, one breakthrough, one challenge at a time.<br>
And if something stands in my way?<br>
I break through.<br>
<br>
Some projects I made:<br>
- Matrix to Rotation & Scale<br>
- GEM RTS to GEM2 entities converter<br>
- GEM2 MDL2FBX<br>
